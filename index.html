        <p>Visual Studio is an IDE, or a Integrated Development Environment.
        The app is easy to set up, as the only things you have to do is install the app, make
        a folder containing the projects you want to make, and import the wanted project into the app.

    <p>The Console Screen is used as a testing screen for coders. Before they publish a website, they Go 
        Live, right click and press, "inspect," to open the screen and check for errors. In order to add a 
        function on the Console Screen, you must use the funtion and then call it to be visible on the screen.
